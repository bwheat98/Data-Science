Stock Prices and News Articles

For this project I have decided to explore the financial industry. More specifically I am curious of the relationship between news articles and the effect it has on the stock market. For this project I have collected two data sets, the first was obtained through Kaggle (called News_Category_Dataset_v2) and it is a dataset of news articles gathered from 2012 - 2018. The second data set is from yahoo finance of the SPY stock index between 2012 - 2020. I chose the SPY because it is a good general indicator of how the overall market is performing. This data could be beneficial in establishing a relationship between current news and the stock markets and help with predicting stocks movement.
